## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it directly via the Discussions tab on our GitHub repository.

Please follow these steps when reporting:

1. Create a new discussion under the Security category.
2. Provide a clear and detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
3. Do not disclose sensitive details publicly until we have reviewed and responded.

We aim to acknowledge your report within 3 business days and will provide regular updates as we assess and address the issue. If the vulnerability is validated, we will coordinate with you on public disclosure timelines and mitigation steps. If the report is declined, we will provide a clear explanation.

Your help in securing this project is greatly appreciated.
